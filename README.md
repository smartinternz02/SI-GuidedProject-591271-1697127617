Project Name: Arming against Violence: YOLO-based Weapon detection

Project Description:
A YOLO-based weapon detection project would involve using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect weapons in images or video streams. 
The YOLO algorithm is a real-time object detection system that is particularly well-suited for detecting multiple objects in an image or video frame. 
The project would likely involve training a YOLO model on a dataset of images and videos that contain weapons, and then using the trained model to detect weapons in new images or videos. 
The goal of the project would likely be to provide a tool that can help to identify and prevent acts of violence by detecting weapons in real-time.

Estimated Project Completion date: 25th October 2023
