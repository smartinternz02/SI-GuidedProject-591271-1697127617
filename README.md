Project Name: Arming against Violence: YOLO-based Weapon detection

Project Description:

A YOLO-based weapon detection project involves using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect weapons in images or video streams. 
The YOLO algorithm is a real-time object detection system that is particularly well-suited for detecting multiple objects in an image or video frame. 
The project involves training a YOLO model on a dataset of images and videos that contain weapons, and then using the trained model to detect weapons in new images or videos. 
The goal of the project is to provide a tool that can help identify and prevent acts of violence by detecting weapons in real-time, to make our neighborhoods and public spaces safer. 

Estimated Project Completion date: 25th October 2023
